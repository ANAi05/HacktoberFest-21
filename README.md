> ### A mentorship initiative to help beginners kickstarting their open-source journey by completing Hacktoberfest'21 challenge.

Here's a home to your queries and quest for potential issues to contribute. I've compiled a handpicked list of **beginner-friendly issues** (& repositories) ahead of time so that you can get the ball rolling once Hacktoberfest kicks off! 🚀 

If you are a beginner, I'll will guide you on getting started with open source and completing your Hacktoberfest challenge. You can begin by introducing yourself in your branch description. If you happen to be experienced in this field, I would be more than grateful to onboard you as a mentor.
